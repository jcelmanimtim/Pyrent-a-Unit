# Pyrent-a-Unit

In the program, three linked lists are maintained for units: 
1. Available for rent 
2. Rented unit
3. Under maintenance unit

The units on the available list are ordered by floor number, with the unit having the first floor at the front of the list. The units on the rented list are ordered by the expected return dates, with the first unit on this list having the earliest expected return date. 
This program promotes the user to choose from the following inputs: 

(1) View available units			

(2) Add a returned unit to the available				

(3) Add a unit to under maintenance list	

(4) Transfer a unit under maintenance list 
to the available for rent list

(5) Rent the first available unit for-rent list

(6) Print all the lists

(7) Quit
